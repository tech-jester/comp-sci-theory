### DFA Examples

We tried these in class, feel free to try before looking at the next diagrams

##### Draw a diagram for DFA<sub>1</sub> and DFA<sub>2</sub>
∑ = { a, b }

DFA<sub>1</sub> -> L<sub>1</sub> = { w | w has exactly two a's }

DFA<sub>2</sub> -> L<sub>2</sub> = { w | w ends with a b }

DFA 1
                  "a"            "a"            "a"
                ------>        ------>        ------>
    ---> (zero)         (one)          ((two))      (more)
          | ^            | ^            | ^          | ^
          | |            | |            | |          | |
          v |            v |            v |          v |
          "b"            "b"            "b"        "a", "b"  

states: zero, one, two, more
accepting states: two
alphabet: a, b
```

```
DFA 2
                                "b"
                       ---------------->
 ---> (does not end with b)            ((ends with b))      
            | ^        <----------------     | ^
            | |                "a"           | |
            "a"                              "b"


states: ends with b, does not end with b
accepting states: ends with b
alphabet: a, b

```
*sidenote* : the prof reemphasized that there will be no partial credit for DFA diagrams. "either its a DFA or it isn't", "there is no way to know where to give partial credit".

Therefore, 
* make sure all your DFA diagrams have an arrow for every alphabet at every 
states. 
    * if there are two letters in your alphabet, then EVERY state must have 2 arrows leaving that state
* make sure that you have a starting state
* make sure that your accepting state matches the requirements
* not required, but give your states appropriate naming

L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> are called a __regular language__

__regular language__ : a language L is a regular language if there is a DFA that accepts it.

You can perform unions, intersections, concatenations, star operation regular languages

L<sub>1</sub> ∪ L<sub>2</sub> = { w | w ∈  L<sub>1</sub> or w ∈ L<sub>2</sub> }
* aaab ends with b
* bbaa has two a's

L<sub>1</sub> ∩ L<sub>2</sub> = { w | w ∈  L<sub>1</sub> and w ∈ L<sub>2</sub> }
* aab is has both two a's and ends in b

L<sub>1</sub> o L<sub>2</sub> = { xy | x ∈  L<sub>1</sub> or y ∈ L<sub>2</sub> }
* aabbbbbaaabbaabbab can be split
    * aa | bbbbbaaabbaabbab 
    * aa has two a's
    * bbbbbaaabbaabbab ends in b
* ORDER is important for concatenation

L<sub>1</sub>* = { a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>a<sub>3</sub>a<sub>...</sub>a<sub>k</sub> | a<sub>i</sub> ∈  L<sub>1</sub> and k ≥ 0 }

* L<sub>ab</sub> = { a, b }
    * L<sub>ab</sub>* = { ε, a, b, ab, ba, aa, bb, ..., aaaaaaa, ... }
    * the set of all strings with a's and b'
* L<sub>01</sub> = { 0, 1 }
    * L<sub>b</sub>* = { ε, 0, 1, 00, 11, 01, 10, ...., 1010101, ....}
    * the set of all binary strings
* the star operation must ALWAYS include an empty string

## Set Theory

Power set: P({})

P( { 1, 2 } ) = { ∅ , { 1 }, { 2 }, { 1, 2 } }
* note: a power set works with SETS
* the set { 1, 2 } is the same as { 2, 1 } therefore it must not be included twice


## Next Time:
The regular language is closed under the union operation
