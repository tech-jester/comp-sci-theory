# CECS 329 - Theory of Computing

## Theory vs. Practical
Theory <-works together-> Practical

---
### Practical
Coding
* purely practical
* last thing you'll do when developing

---

### Theory
*CECS 329 IS A THEORY CLASS*
<br>*All about proofs*

* design patterns
* project length estimation
    * can be very difficult to estimate

### Proofs
* Can I solve a problem?
    
* Is "finding a path between cities" solvable
    * categorize this problem as solvable
    * solvable in thoery might not be solvable in practical
    * solvable using a machine ( use "machine computer" )
        * DFA
        * PDA 
        * TURING

*Prof Nguyen self introduction* <br> Is developing an android app to interact directly with the microcontroller of construciton traffic signs. These devices are closer to PDA's. Nguyen develops an app that allows users to interact with these signs without needing to know the commands needed within the pda

![traffic sign example](https://www.trans-supply.com/MediaStorage/Product/Images/Small/1064_0612201819263710630.png)

Some of these signs work like this, there is a 10x6 bitmap. Depending on the size of the board, this can be used to display an image on the message board. They follow ITS Standards. These are not very secure, you're at the mercy of the person that owns it.
"It can be difficult, sometimes you hit a roadblock when developign so I don't say yes all the time Sometimes I say I'll take a look at it." - Nguyen

*on the subject of learning* <br>don't depend on what we've learned at school, this is only the tip of the iceberg. You'd be surprised to find what you can learn by working on a project

* native platforms (you can learn)
    * SQL
    * CLOUD 
    * IOS 
    * ANDROID 
        * GRADLE
    * FLUTTER
    * DOCKER

*on the subject of data*<br>
It is possible to track the position of someones phone.
Based on the use of the accelerometer, it is possible to know if the phone is face down/face up, vertically in your pocket. This way it is possible to reasonably guess if you're on the move, sitting at a table, in your vehicle. This information can be used for advertising and other uses.

---

*on communication*<br>
send an email, sometimes the inbox on canvas doesn't get synced and it does not notify/send.

--- 
*on quizzes/exams*<br>
* no lecture on the day of the quizzes
* in order to show work, you must use hand written proofs and solutions
    * typed solutions will not be accepted.
    * try to follow the closest path to the right solution

*sidenote:* in the real world you don't get partial credit. either it works or it doesn't.

this failure led to a lot of people dying. floating point error caused errors accumulating problems in the system.

referring to "Theory of Computation" <br>
"We will be using this book for our exercises" - Nguyen

Roughly every 4 weeks we will receive a testing item. 

***There are video lectures by the author of the book in MIT***

"I rarely give people F unless you don't come"-Nguyen. The scale is more flexible than you think. 
"If you get a B on the inal, I'm willing to pass you". (This is a case by case basis, you may wish to talk to prof Nguyen per your specific case)
