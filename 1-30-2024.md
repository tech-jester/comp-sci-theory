Finite State Machine
(Deterministic finite Automation - DFA)
* Simplest model of computing


Flaws of DFA
* the states MUST have an option for every alphabet. (must have a transition function)

### Example 
```
Diagram of Door Opening State Machine

[front pad] | [read pad]
            ^
          door


                          "state"
read both neither   front   |
    ->              v       v
    <-(closed) -------> (open) -> front,rear,both
            ^  <-------        <-
            |       ^
            |       |
            |      neither <-- direction "transition function"
            "state"

labels on the arror are called input for transition function "alphabet"

This state matchine should determine whether to open the door or close the door. This has no memory,.

(Q states): closed, open

(∑ alphabet/inputs): front, rear, both (front AND rear), neither (NOT (front OR rear))


state: OPEN
    * neither -> STATE=closed
    * front, rear, both -> STATE=OPEN (no change)
state: CLOSED
    * front -> STATE=open
    * rear, both, neither -> STATE=CLOSED (no change)


```

## Deterministic Finite Automation (DFA) 

DFA D = ( Q, ∑, δ, q<sub>◦</sub>, F)
* Q = finite set of states
* ∑ = finite set of alphabets
* δ = transition function
* q<sub>◦</sub> = q<sub>◦</sub> ∈ Q the starting state
* F = F ⊆ Q the set of accepting states


---

Word: a sequence of alphabets/inputs
* in the door example , the input sequence
    * (front | both | rear | neither)
* in english
    * a, b, c, d, e, f, ..., z

Langage: a collections of ((inputs / alphabet) in sequence)
* in the door example,, 
    * {(front | both | rear | neither), ( front | neither), (rear)}
        * each word is a sequence of inputs
* in english
    * { a, b, ..., ab, ..., z, ...}

The Door DFA recognizes the Door language.

---
OPEN is the accepting state.

Signature of transition function
δ = <sup>n</sup>Q x ∑ -> Q<sup>n</sup>

in computer programming can be represented as <br>
state = transition func ( state q, alphabet a)

In the door example, the front transition function can be represented as
```
δ ( CLOSED, FRONT ) = OPEN
```
all of these must be written for every state x alphabet 
```
δ ( CLOSED, FRONT ) = OPEN
δ ( CLOSED, REAR ) = CLOSED
δ ( CLOSED, BOTH ) = CLOSED
δ ( CLOSED, NEITHER ) = CLOSED
δ ( OPEN, FRONT ) = OPEN
δ ( OPEN, REAR ) = OPEN
δ ( OPEN, BOTH ) = OPEN
δ ( OPEN, NEITHER ) = CLOSED
```
however you can write this as a table 

| δ \ a      | BOTH   | NEITHER | FRONT | REAR   |
|------------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| **CLOSED** | CLOSED | CLOSED  | OPEN  | CLOSED | 
| **OPEN**   | OPEN   | CLOSED  | OPEN  | OPEN   |

### Example
```
∑ = { 0, 1 }
L = { w | |w| is even } <- *set builder notation*
  = { 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, ..., 111, ... }

why did we pick the following?
1: is odd
100 (base 10): is even 
10, 01, 11, 00: length is 2
1010: length is 4
```

```
∑ = { 0, 1 }
```
element w such that the length of w is even.

w: element w

|w|: length of the word

in this case

| L | = cardinality of a set, in this case is infinity


*note*: what you cannot do is, read the entire sequence at once, the DFA does not have memory for it. 

you cannot use 
~~```bool isEven("____") -> true, false```~~

### example
```
              1, 0
          ----------->
    ->((even))       (odd)
          <-----------
              0, 1

states: (odd), ((even))
starting state: ((even))
accepting state: ((even))
alphabet: 0, 1
```

make sure your machine accepts words that its suppoed to accept, and rejects words that its supposed to reject
