## Proof By Contradiction
PROVE: 
```
There are infinitely many primes
```
Prime: a positive integer whose only factors are 1 and itself.

Contradiction
```
Suppose there are finitely many primes
```
We must prove that there are primes outside of a finite list

P<sub>1</sub> • P<sub>2</sub> • ..., P<sub>k</sub>

We need to show that there must be a prime p that is not on the list above.

Consider p = P<sub>1</sub> • P<sub>2</sub> • ..., P<sub>k</sub> + **1**

Note that P is not on the list, AND P ∈ ℤ+ (P is in the set of positive numbers)

Consider two cases for P
1) P is prime. __that means you have found a prime number that is not on the list above__.
2) P is NOT prime. 
<br>∴ P is a composite number.
<br>∴ By the fundamental theorem  of number theory, P can be factored into the product of primes.

    P = a<sub>1</sub><sup>α<sub>1</sub></sup> • a<sub>2</sub><sup>α<sub>2</sub></sup> • ..., • a<sub>m</sub><sup>α<sub>m</sub></sup> 
    <br>where a<sub>1</sub><sup>α<sub>1</sub></sup> • a<sub>2</sub><sup>α<sub>2</sub></sup> • ..., • a<sub>m</sub><sup>α<sub>m</sub></sup> are primes 
    <br>and a<sub>1</sub><sup>α<sub>1</sub></sup> • a<sub>2</sub><sup>α<sub>2</sub></sup> • ..., • a<sub>m</sub><sup>α<sub>m</sub></sup> are positive integers

At least one of the primes from a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>m</sub>
is not on the list above because P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>k</sub> divided into p will always yield a remainder of **1**. 

∴ P  must have some other prime as a prime factor. 

You cannot have finitely many primes, therefore you there are infinitely many primes.

## Functions and Notations

in this domain, functions are going to be written like

𝑓: A -> B
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ↦  𝑓(x) = x<sup>2</sup>

A is input domain

B is ouput codomain (contains range)

𝑓 : ℤ -> ℤ
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ↦  𝑓(x) = x<sup>2</sup>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range = { 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 }

𝑓 : ℝ -> ℝ
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ↦  𝑓(x) = x<sup>2</sup>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range = { x ∈ ℝ | x<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0 }

---
Other notations

A x B = { (a, b) | a ∈ A ^ b ∈ B }
P(A) = the set of all subsets of A (power set)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 to 1, onto, 1 to 1 and onto

1 to 1: Every input has a unique output
<br>onto: Every output must have an input
<br>1 to 1 and onto: Every input has a unique output and every output must have an input
